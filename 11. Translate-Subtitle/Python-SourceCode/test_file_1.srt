00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,180
In this animation we'll see the remarkable way our DNA is tightly

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,389
packed up to fit into the nucleus of every cell.

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,719
The process starts with assembly of a
nucleosome which is formed when eight

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,719
separate histone proteins sub 
units attach to the DNA molecule.

5
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:28,599
The combined tight loop of DNA 
and protein is the nucleosome.

6
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,850
Multiple nucleosomes are coiled together
and these then stack on top of each other.

7
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,740
The end result is a fiber of packed
nucleosomes known as a chromatin.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,990
This fiber, which at this point is condensed 
to a thickness of thirty nanometers,

9
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,030
is then looped and further packaged using
other proteins which are not shown here.

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,960
This remarkable multiple folding allows
six feet of DNA to fit into the nucleus

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,630
of each cell in our body.

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:06,630
An object so small that ten thousand
nuclei could fit on the tip of a needle.

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,680
The end result is that the DNA is
tightly packed into the familiar

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,630
structures we can see through 
a microscope, chromosomes.

15
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,560
It is important to realize that
chromosomes are not always present. They

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,150
form only when cells are dividing.

17
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,700
At other times as we can see here at 
the end of cell division, our DNA becomes

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,179
less highly organized.
